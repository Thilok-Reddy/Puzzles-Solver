# Puzzles-Solver
Program
The program is designed to find a valid mathematical expression with N numbers and arithmetic operators that evaluates to a target value X. It offers multiple search algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A*, to find a valid solution to the puzzle.

Input Data
The program takes two inputs:

N: The number of values to be used in the expression.
X: The target value that the expression should evaluate to.

Output Data
The program provides the following output:

If a valid solution is found, it prints the valid mathematical expression that meets the criteria.
If no valid solutions are found, it prints a message indicating that no valid solutions were found.
